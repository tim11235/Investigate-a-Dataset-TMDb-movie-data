# Investigate-a-Dataset-TMDb-movie-data

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. I want to perform an analysis on relationships some variables might have with others and visualize how some variables have affected others over the years.
The size of the Dataset is (10866, 21). This means that we have 10866 movies and 21 columns. Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
